This package helps test the connection of the servo motor assuming that a proper physical connection has been established. 
It also helps manage the driver versions. 
```
ls /dev/tty*
```
to see if a USB connection has been established. Then open Dynamixel Wizard, click on options to shorten the scan, and finally do scan. If a motor connection is found, it would look like this.
